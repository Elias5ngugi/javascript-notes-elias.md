# Data Types

JavaScript has the following basic data types which are also the primitive data types in JavaScript (more about this later):
- String
- Number

- Boolean

- null

- undefined

- Bigint

- Symbo

# String

Refers to a sequence of characters enclosed within single quotes (`'`), double quotes (`"`) or backticks.
```js
let firstName = "john";
let lastName = "doe";
let username = `john_doe`;
```
# Number

JavaScript has only one type for numbers: it can store both integers and decimals.
```js
let age = 25; // Integer
let price = 99.99; // Decimal
let notANumber = NaN; // Not a Number (invalid math operation)
```
# Boolean

Booleans represent true or false values, often used for decision-making.

Boolean can either be `true` or `false`.
```js
let isMale = true;
let isFemale = false;
```
`undefined`

Refers to a variable that has been declared but not initialized
```js
let country;
console.log(country); // Output: undefined
```
`null`

`null` is an intentional absence of a value. Unlike `undefined`, which means "not assigned," null means "empty on purpose."
```js
let car = null; // No car yet
```
# BigInt

Used for numbers beyond JavaScript’s `Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER` (9,007,199,254,740,991).
```js
let bigNumber = 123456789012345678901234567890n; // "n" at the end makes it a BigInt
console.log(bigNumber);
```

# Checking the type of a variable using the `typeof` operator 

You can check the type of a variable using the `typeof` operator in JavaScript.
```js
let bigNumber = 123456789012345678901234567890n;
console.log(typeof bigNumber); // bigint
// OR
console.log(typeof bigNumber); // bigint

const age = 25;
const fullName = "John Doe";

console.log(typeof age); // number
console.log(typeof fullName); // string
```
